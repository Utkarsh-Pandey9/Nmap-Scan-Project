# 🌐 DNS Scans with Nmap

## 🔹 Purpose
DNS (Domain Name System) resolution translates human-readable domain names (like `facebook.com`) into IP addresses.  
Nmap offers options to customize DNS servers, skip DNS resolution, or bypass host discovery. These options are useful for faster scanning, avoiding detection, or working around blocked services.

## 🔹 Commands Used

### 1. Using a Custom DNS Server
```bash
nmap facebook.com --dns-servers 1.1.1.1



2. Skipping DNS Resolution
nmap -n facebook.com

The -n option tells Nmap not to perform reverse DNS lookups, so only IP addresses are shown.
This makes the scan faster and avoids unnecessary DNS queries.

3. Skipping DNS + Assuming Host is Up
nmap -n -Pn facebook.com


The -Pn option tells Nmap to treat the host as up, even if it does not respond to ping/ICMP probes.
