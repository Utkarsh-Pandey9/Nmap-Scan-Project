It sends ICMP Echo Requests and checks if the target replies with Echo Replies.

## ğŸ”¹ Command Used
```bash
ping 192.168.1.10(ip of your target machine)

## ğŸ”¹ Expected Outcome

- If the target is **alive and reachable**, it will respond with `Reply from 192.168.1.10` messages.  
- If the target is **unreachable**, you may see `Request timed out`.
